# Me

Hi!  I'm Antonio.  I'm a Clinical Laboratory Application Snalyst at the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
I am also a Teaching Assistant for the University of Pennsylvania's Masters in Computer and Information Technology online program.


# Work

## UPHS

As a Clinical Laboratory Application Analyst, I am responsible for building, testing, and maintaining multiple middleware systems.
These systems interface the laboratory instruments to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
In the last five or so years, we've expanded from a team of me, managing one system, to a team of four, managing seven systems (and still growing).  

## UPenn

As a Teaching Assistant, I am responsible for guiding students through the learning process.
I focus on the two core courses relating to C coding: CIT593 (Intro to Computer Systems) and CIT595 (Computer Systems Programming).
Most of the time is dedicated to meeting with students in office hours or asynchronously on course discussions boards, to explain concepts or assist debugging programs.

CIT593 is a bits-to-C course designed to go from the basics of binary, to logic gates, sequential/combinatorial circuits, assembly (in LC4, an education assembly language), and finally to C.
On the side, I additionally help write and manage course autograders and the backend LC4 simulator (PennSim).

CIT595 is a continuation of CIT593 focusing more on the operating system, system calls, concurrency, file management, and networking.
I also assist with writing and maintaining the course autograders.
